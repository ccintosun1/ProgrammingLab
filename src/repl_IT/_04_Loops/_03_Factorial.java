In mathematics a `factorial` number is a positive integer that is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to the `n` number. It is commonly written as `n!` In other words, a factorial value is the number multiplied to the number less than it, multiplied by the number less than it, repeating until 1. See the examples for clarification.Main topics: loops, primitive datatypes, operators, Scanner```Ex:  Input:    5  Output:    120  -> The calculation would be:    5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120``````Ex:  Input:    8  Output:    40320  -> The calculation would be:    8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320```         */    }}
