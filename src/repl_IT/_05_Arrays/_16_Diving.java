There will be a total of seven judge scores. From the scores the highest and lowest will be discarded and the remaining `five will be added together`. That sum will then be multiplied by a difficulty rating ranging from `1.2` to `3.8`. In the end the final score will be determined by multiplying the value by `0.6`#### Create the program with this flow:> - Ask for the seven judges' scores using the following message and store the scores into an `int []`    - `Enter score for judge 1:`    - `Enter score for judge 2:`    - etc for all seven judges> - Ask for the difficulty rating. `Range of 1.2 - 3.8`    - `Enter the difficulty rating:`> - Finish the calculation by multiply the value by `0.6` and print the total score:    - `Final Score: $score`Main topics: arrays, primitive datatypes, index, operators, loops, counter, ScannerExample Flow:```Enter score for judge 1:1Enter score for judge 2:5Enter score for judge 3:5Enter score for judge 4:5Enter score for judge 5:5Enter score for judge 6:8Enter score for judge 7:9Enter the difficulty rating:2.1Final Score: 35.28``` */
