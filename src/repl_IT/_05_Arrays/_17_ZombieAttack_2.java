For example, the following arrays shows 8 cities and their respective populations:```[3, 6, 0, 4, 3, 2, 7, 0]```Some cities have a population of 0 due to a pandemic zombie disease that is wiping out the human lives. After each day, **any city that is adjacent to a zombie-ridden city will lose half of its population (City that has a 0 population)**.Write a program to loop though each city population and make it lose half of its population if it is adjacent(right or left) to a city with zero people until all cities have no humans are left.Make updates to each element in the array and print the array like below for each day:Note: A city can only be affected once each day```Day 0 [3, 6, 0, 4, 3, 2, 7, 0]Day 1 [3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0]Day 2 [3, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0]Day 3 [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0]Day 4 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]Day 5 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]---- EXTINCT ----```Write the program in a way that it will handle any number of people in cities, above was just an example. */
