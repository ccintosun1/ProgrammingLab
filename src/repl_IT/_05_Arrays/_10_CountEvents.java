You don't need to fully understand this part yet, focus only on having access to an array and has some numbers.Main topics: arrays, primitive datatypes, concatenation, index, operators, loops, if statementsExample:```Input:  [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]Output:  3```Example:```Input:  [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]Output:  0``` */
